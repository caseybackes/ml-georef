### Machine Learning and CNN Assisted Georeferencing of Remote Sensing Imagery

Quick Introduction

Georeferencing satellite imagery is typically done by hand using ground control points (GCPs) from a refence image data set that is already georeferenced. This can be fairly quick - albeit tedious -  process in any GIS platform depending on the number of GCPs used for georefencing. The number and quality of GCPs will directly impact the quality of the linear mathematical solution for the georeferencing the image data being processed. This project aims to accelerate the process of georeferencing fresh image data while maintaining (or even surpassing) geospatial location accuracy.
