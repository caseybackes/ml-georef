Purpose:
Automatically georeference remote sensing imagery of arbitrary spatial resolution in the visible band.  
Objective:
Correctly georeference input imagery to within 5 pixel accuracy without regard for spatial resolution. 

Planning and Project Phases:
Input image -> 
	classify segments for high quality ground control points -> 
		download free imagery at comparable spatial resolution -> 
			Calculate the coefficients for the spatial transform -> 
				Apply spatial transform to new geotiff image derived from input image -> 
					Verify results in GIS platform (QGIS). 


Phase 0: Curate input training data 
	Determine additional input metadata
Phase 1: Train CNN model for ground control point (GCP) identification 
Phase 2: Using CNN model, capture pixel coordinates of high quality input image GCPs  
	Probably need to resample to same resolution
Phase 3: Using CNN model, locate same features in reference image data, taking the lat, long location 
Phase 4: Use the lat long GCPs and pixel locations in input image to calculate linear transform coefficients
	Linear is fine, it calibrates for translation, rotation, and skew. 
Phase 5: Generate new GEOTIFF of input image with applied transform. 
Phase 6: Verify results qualitatively via QGIS and qualify performance. Determine and implement improvements.
